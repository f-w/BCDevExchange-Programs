##Long term plans
We will continue to collaborate with the local tech sector to identify other opportunities to grow the sector, create innovative tech products and services, and build better services for citizens. Future projects could build on using the work on a reminder service for other types of local events.

##Background Info
In xxxx xx, the City adopted the Canadian Open Government Licence (OGL). It gives users consistent terms for accessing and using government data, making it easier to combine, integrate, and share data from multiple providers across Canada. This is a major step towards encouraging wider use of open data and delivering more value to the public. The City joins the Government of Canada, Provinces of BC, Alberta, and Ontario, and the cities of Nanaimo, Vancouver, Surrey, Edmonton, and Toronto in adopting the OGL.
